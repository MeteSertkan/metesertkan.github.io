        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m an Applied Scientist intern at Amazon Search and a PhD in Computer Science from TU Wien. I study how people seek and discover information—and build systems that respond better. My work sits where search and recommendations meet, with a focus on making results feel relevant, consistent, and fair for real users.</p>
        <p>I care a lot about rigor and reliability: clear problem framing, trustworthy evaluation, and reproducible workflows. I like turning research ideas into clean, well-documented systems that teams can maintain and grow with confidence. Along the way, I’ve collaborated with industry and academia and published 30+ papers (15 first-author, 600+ citations). If you’re into search, recommender systems, and rigorous evaluation, we’ll have plenty to talk about..</p>

            <p>As an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Search, I advanced query understanding by developing a unified multi-task model based on a Mixture-of-LoRA Experts architecture. My work emphasized context-aware expert routing to improve consistency across signals, balance task interactions, and enable efficient adaptation under compute constraints. In addition, I established a reproducible experimentation pipeline, introduced new evaluation metrics, and delivered actionable insights to science and product teams.</p>
